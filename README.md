# Home

Home automation application *Frontend*.
Corresponding with HomematicCCU/Historian via HomeController *Backend*.

Commented application.properties needed to be configured in external 'homeapp.properties'

Sources in /domain/ -packages are depending on individual Homematic setup and therefore needed to be changed.

Application is based on Spring Boot.
